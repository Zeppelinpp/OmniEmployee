# Codebase Tools Skill

This skill provides advanced capabilities for exploring, analyzing, and modifying codebases. It includes powerful search functionality, precise file editing tools, and intelligent code navigation features.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Search for specific code patterns, function definitions, or variable usages across the codebase
- Navigate complex project structures and understand code organization
- Make precise, targeted modifications to source code files
- Analyze code dependencies and relationships
- Perform bulk operations like renaming variables or updating function calls

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Code Search and Analysis
- **grep**: Search file contents using ripgrep with regex support
- **list_dir**: Explore directory structure and find files
- Pattern matching with case sensitivity, file type filtering, and context lines

### 2. File Operations  
- **read_file**: Read entire files or specific line ranges
- **write_file**: Write content with various modes (overwrite, append, insert, replace_lines)
- Automatic directory creation for new files

### 3. Intelligent Navigation
- Understand project layout and code organization
- Find related files and dependencies
- Locate specific functions, classes, or variables

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Read before modifying** - Always understand current state before changes
2. **Minimal changes** - Make focused, targeted modifications  
3. **Verify results** - Confirm changes work as expected
4. **Respect conventions** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Common Workflows

#### Finding and Understanding Code
```
1. list_dir(path="src/") → Understand project structure
2. grep(pattern="\\bfunction_name\\b", file_type="py") → Find function definition  
3. read_file(path="src/module.py") → Examine implementation
```

#### Making Targeted Changes
```
1. grep(pattern="old_variable_name") → Find all occurrences
2. For each occurrence:
   a. read_file(...) → Get context
   b. write_file(..., mode="replace_lines") → Update
3. grep(pattern="old_name") → Verify no remaining occurrences
```
